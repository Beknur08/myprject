# Friendly Telegram Userbot

A fast, easy to set up telegram userbot running Python 3 which uses fork of
the [Telethon](https://github.com/GeekTG/Telethon) Library.

Friendly Telegram, also known as FTG, is not your average Telegram userbot: it's faster, can load modules dynamically
and is very easy to use!

## Changes

- Latest Telethon lib
- Security improvements (.session file name not contain full phone number, DeleteAccountRequest disabled, and more)
- UX improvements (IP address in config script, random port on first launch, etc)
- Stock modules updates (New functions, bug fixed)
- [Modules Repo](https://github.com/GeekTG/FTG-Modules) with a great variety of modules
- FFmpeg support for Heroku
- Fixed bugs
- Adaptability of modules

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- API ID and Hash from [Telegram](https://my.telegram.org/apps)
- Some basic knowledge (although you can usually mindlessly copy&paste from the docs)

### Documentation

We've made docs to help you to set up the bot. They can be found [here](https://ftg.geektg.ml).

### Support

We also have a dedicated Telegram support group. Got any doubts or issues while setting-up? Shoot 'em here! **Please
read the docs first** though, to make sure your question isn't already answered!
